I'm a hardcore Joe Rogan fan. Through this project, I want to watch some interesting short tangents that have appeared on the past shows of the JRE.

Steps:
1. Get YT video link and download the video in 4k
2. Get subtitles with timestamps
    1. Provided by Youtube
    2. Extracted using AI
3. Prompt LLM to find a short story within the whole video and return exact uttered text with subtitles.
4. Use the timestamps to piece together the short story and then export the video
5. Upload it to my new channel

6. Better Algo to concatenate clips
7. Add subtitle texts to the video
8. Portrait mode - how to focus on the speaker - need computer vision?
9. zoom in and out??
10. Pass in an hour long podcast transcript??


Immediate tasks:
1. Do 4k video download
2. Automate using AI
