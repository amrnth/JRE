The jogan Experience so I get picked up,0.919,4.241
in Atlanta take me to Atlanta jail I go,3.52,3.12
and put me in this modular and I go in,5.16,3.16
this modular and there's black people,6.64,3.68
all the different races right well over,8.32,3.56
there they don't politic like we do in,10.32,3.76
California right so this is my,11.88,4.159
first understanding of how the system,14.08,3.8
works right so I go in there and the,16.039,3.361
only thing that you can't do in that,17.88,2.96
system is you can't eat at the same,19.4,3.48
table with a different,20.84,5.0
race besides that once you're up from,22.88,5.559
the dinner table I can trade with any,25.84,4.64
race I could do whatever talk to chop it,28.439,3.761
up like but you have to eat with people,30.48,3.56
of your own,32.2,5.519
race so then uh and they tell you this,34.04,6.4
so somebody informs you oh yeah oh yeah,37.719,4.641
I got informed when I in so when I when,40.44,4.04
I move from Atlanta to California,42.36,4.4
California politics much different you,44.48,4.48
can't trade you can't trade with with,46.76,4.36
blacks you can't trade with others you,48.96,4.32
can't trade with so you can only do,51.12,4.119
trade with your race and then the whites,53.28,4.0
get along with the the essay so what end,55.239,4.401
up happening is like so you have others,57.28,4.52
which are any other race besides Mexican,59.64,4.4
white or black and this is a car it's,61.8,3.999
called a car right so everybody has a,64.04,4.2
car their own race so you have Woods you,65.799,5.32
have skin heads you have pisas you got,68.24,5.64
Mexicans you got Crips Bloods and others,71.119,4.441
and the pisas roll with the Mexicans the,73.88,4.16
skin heads roll with the woods yeah and,75.56,4.599
if something really pops off some R sh,78.04,3.759
then Mexicans and the and the whites,80.159,3.361
will click up against the blacks or the,81.799,4.36
blacks always all them against us it,83.52,4.52
always suck to be it suck to be black in,86.159,3.64
them times I'm telling you real [ __ ] we,88.04,3.96
get hey well we dumped though we,89.799,4.32
dumped so so we always knock them out,92.0,3.479
anyway so you start fig trying to figure,94.119,2.64

[ __ ] guards watched all everybody's,290.24,3.0
watching from their cells you know like,291.8,3.92
this is a different time so this whole,293.24,4.16
incident takes place I beat this guy up,295.72,4.319

don't really care the guards [ __ ] they,306.16,3.12
don't give a [ __ ] so you [ __ ] that,308.16,3.68
dude up is he out cold or does he have a,309.28,4.479
do they have to ask him do they have to,311.84,4.4
ask him what his story is I don't give a,313.759,4.16
[ __ ] they but they don't they don't ask,316.24,4.6
you they just let you go it's okay what,317.919,4.28
what like is there a punishment is,320.84,3.359
that's what I'm getting they lock me my,322.199,3.761
I couldn't get on my cell for like two,324.199,4.961
weeks oh for two weeks yeah just alone,325.96,4.92
in yourself,329.16,4.52
const the door so what happens is is for,330.88,3.96
a certain amount of hours of the day,333.68,2.2
they got to pop the door and let you,334.84,3.16
into a bigger cell a bigger room you,335.88,4.8
know what I mean so I just couldn't get,338.0,5.44
into the the day room for like two weeks,340.68,5.28
but the crazy [ __ ] of it all is like I'm,343.44,3.68
trying to tell you I'm trying to learn,345.96,4.2
this this system right this new rules so,347.12,4.76
what happens is this kid this guy okay,350.16,3.28
we talk about the cars and the races,351.88,3.64
right so each race has their own car,353.44,4.24
which means there's a key holder the key,355.52,5.0
holder to that car controls the race,357.68,4.32
so they make decisions for the race they,360.52,3.56
TR and keep other races out of car,362.0,3.759
wrecks like now we got a feud with the,364.08,2.64
blacks or we got a feud with the,365.759,2.681
Mexicans or whatever they call them car,366.72,4.0
wrecks yeah well if we get in a fight,368.44,5.0
with them the keyh holder is the guy,370.72,4.36
that can communicate with the other keyh,373.44,3.44
holders to the races and trying to keep,375.08,5.28
delegated wow yeah and so I didn't had,376.88,4.68
it happen where we going to get out with,380.36,2.959
the Mexicans and then our keys will go,381.56,3.68
and they keys and and we F to jump we,383.319,3.361
getting ready to jump and they and they,385.24,3.2
shake hands all right it ain't going it,386.68,5.32
ain't going and and it go back down so,388.44,4.56
yeah and you're trying to figure all,392.0,2.319
this out so what happened was I beat,393.0,3.96
this Fool's ass and now I'm I got the,394.319,5.481
keys oh wow but I can't have the keys,396.96,4.28
because I'm a first termer so first,399.8,3.08
termer is not allowed to have the keys,401.24,3.2
but nobody nobody wanted to try to take,402.88,3.8
the keys from me so in order for them to,404.44,3.4
take the keys from me they got to fight,406.68,3.959
me to take the keys away from me oh boy,407.84,5.88
so so that kind of changed the Dynamics,410.639,5.28
of the of the room because now I'm able,413.72,5.159
to navigate with these other races and,415.919,4.761
have these convers ations with these,418.879,4.44
[ __ ] ignorant people that don't,420.68,5.32
understand how to how to really talk you,423.319,4.0
know what I mean like how to communicate,426.0,3.84
and and and keep things cool they they,427.319,4.641
they misunderstand what this guy says or,429.84,3.52
misinterpret what this guy says and next,431.96,3.359
thing you know it's hot for everybody,433.36,2.92
you know and it's just,435.319,2.641
misinterpretations yeah yeah cuz they're,436.28,4.96
dumb mostly these guys are dumb bro like,437.96,5.88

wrong and then that escalated into,459.72,4.599
something that's was personal yeah half,461.28,5.319
quick so now they take me from there,464.319,3.681
that incident takes place right and we,466.599,4.521
